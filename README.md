## About Pokeproject

Pokeproject is a web application born from my passion for the known franchise *Pokémon*. I decided to create an application that recreated my own conception of a Pokédex. A clean and minimalistic app focused on being able to find your favourite Pokémon, building your own teams and share them with the world.

## Features

### Pokédex

There's a section for each generation and a section including all generations. There are currenty 2 generations.

</p>

Each generation has a list of Pokémon and you can check their data.

## Future plans

Some functionality to include in the future can be:
- Able to not only vote but comment team publications.
- Feed filter (most trending, most liked, most recent...)
- Sync the application with a real Pokémon videogame.
